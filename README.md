 A Card game hub in cpp including blackjack and Solitaire

Blackjack is classic blackjack where the dealer stands at 17.

The type of Solitaire is hit or miss solitaire which is played by counting in your head from ace to king while placing cards down from a shuffled deck. When the card you count in your head is the same as what you place down, you add it to the hits pile. You play until there are no more cards left, or until you go through the deck twice without hitting once.

This specific type of Solitaire is very difficult to win. I have edited the rules in my version so that the deck can be reshuffled every time you can't get a hit when going through them and you only need to hit 20 times to win the game. This is to make the game more fun, more beatable, and make it take less time to complete.
