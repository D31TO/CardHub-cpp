 A Card game hub in cpp including blackjack and Solitaire

Blackjack is classic blackjack where the dealer stands at 17.

The type of Solitaire is hit or miss solitaire which is played by counting in your head from ace to king while placing cards down from a shuffled deck. When the card you count in your head is the same as what you place down, you add it to the hits pile. You play until there are no more cards left, or until you go through the deck twice without hitting once.
